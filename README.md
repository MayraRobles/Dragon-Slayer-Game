# Dragon-Slayer-Game
 The objective of the game is to defeat a dragon that has been bothering villagers from the nearby town. To succeed, the character will first equip itself with a sword and a shield. Both items got lost in time. 
The mission of the game is to find and acquire both sacred tools to stop the nightmare of the fearsome monster.
In order for the character to discover its surroundings, he/she should move one block left, right, up, or down from its current position. The world is modeled as a 2-D dungeon.
